This file contains my notes on how I approached and solved the problem, along with the algorithm's time complexity.

The way I approached this problem was looping every element of the array, saving it on a variable and then every time the element was looped make the sum and save it in the variable.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because of the variable that defines the algorithm, that is a random number or is better to say that the sizes of the algorithm is N elements.
